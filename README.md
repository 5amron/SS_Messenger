# ss-messenger

this is a chat application that is based on node.js web applications. we used node passport module 
to authenticate users in login page and sotre sessions in mongoDB. in this case MongoLab helped us 
as a perfect DB! it's a good idea to store sessions in database in comparison with sotring them in memory or caching. 
(but of course you can handle authentication process and sessions by your own middlewares!) 
by socket.io module it connects user on every client side and it has only public channel for now.

and it's not appropriate for mobile view yet.
maybe later it will be more developed.
